        <p>
          Hello! I’m Aishwarya, a senior at Barnard College majoring in Computer
          Science. This portfolio showcases projects that best reflect my skills
          and passion for the field. While my degree focuses on intelligent
          systems, I’ve developed a keen interest in exploring other areas,
          including cloud-based applications, web development, and finance
          applications. I’m always eager to broaden my expertise and dive into
          the endless opportunities that computer science provides.

            <h3>Food Rating Application Based on AI Generated Recipes</h3>
            <p>
              Collaborated with a team of four to develop a cloud-based
              application leveraging AWS, Angular, and the OpenAI API to
              generate AI-powered recipes and facilitate user ratings. The
              application integrates over four microservices and two PostgreSQL
              databases to efficiently handle recipe generation, data storage,
              and user interaction.

            <h3>Edge Detector and Coin Identifier</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a custom Non-Maximal Suppression and Hough Accumulator
              algorithm from scratch to detect edges in images effectively.
              Designed and implemented a robust coin identification system
              achieving approximately 88% accuracy in noisy images and 100%
              accuracy in clean conditions.
